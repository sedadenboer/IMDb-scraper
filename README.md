# Scraping

This project contains a few Python files from the data scraping assignment from the programming minor at UvA. In these files we're scraping the IMDb website with the top movies from 1930-2020. Eventually there will be different modifications and analyses of the data.

## The files and their purpose
- helpers.py: premade helper file from assignment
- scraper.py: scrapes at least 5 movies for every year between 1930-2020 from IMDb 
- extract.py: extracts top 5 movies for every year
- visualize_years.py: visualizes the average rating of top 5 IMDb movies for every year
- visualize_actors.py: visualizes the popularity of the top 50 actors from the top 5 IMDb movies file
- crawler.py: scrapes additional language info from individual movie websites from the top 5 IMDb movies file
- visualize_languages.py: visualizes language influences over the last 9 decades for the 10 most popular languages in the top 5 IMDb movies file
